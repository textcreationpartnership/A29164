            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <hi>JOHN, V. Ch. latter part of the 14. v.</hi>
                  </bibl>
                  <p>Behold, thou art made whole; Sin no more, leſt a worſe thing come unto thee.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THESE words were ſpoken by our bleſſed Saviour, to one whom he had reſcu'd from a troubleſome Infirmity, which (otherwiſe than by Miracle) ſeem'd to be incurable. But as all the Actions of his Life were <hi>general Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,</hi> ſo all the Words of his Mouth were <hi>univerſal Precepts;</hi> none of them being ſo narrowly reſtrain'd
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54282:5"/>to that particular occaſion, as not to be applicable to others attended with the like Circumſtances: I ſhall not therefore fear to over-ſtrain the Senſe of my Text, by making uſe of it upon the preſent occaſion; and addreſſing my ſelf to thoſe who now hear me, as he did to the Man whom he had healed; <hi>Behold, thou art made whole; Sin no more, leſt a worſe thing come unto thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed if we would employ our ſelves accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as we ought, upon <hi>this Solemn Day</hi> of Faſting and Mortification; if we would ſtrictly examine our Souls, and nicely pry into the ſecrets of our Conſciences; I fear there would be found but few amongſt us all, whoſe <hi>murmuring and repining</hi> under the Judgments which hung over them, whoſe <hi>careleſsneſs and impenitency</hi> upon their being withdrawn, whoſe <hi>ingratitude and preſumption</hi> under the bleſſings they have received, may not juſtly call for the caution contained in my Text, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, thou art made whole; Sin no more, leſt a worſe thing come unto thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since then it has pleaſed the Divine Goodneſs, by the repeated Mercies which have been extended towards theſe Nations, almoſt to change our <hi>Days of humiliation,</hi> into ſolemn <hi>Feſtivals of Thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving;</hi> I ſhall therefore endeavour in my following Diſcourſe, to follow this Method of the Divine Providence, by intermixing with our penitential <hi>Acknowledgments,</hi> ſome <hi>Hymns of Praiſe and Songs of Deliverance.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:54282:5"/>
            <p>In purſuance of which Deſign, I ſhall inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on five Particulars: Whereof the <hi>two former</hi> are <hi>implied</hi> in the Text, and the <hi>three latter expreſly deliver'd</hi> in it.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. I ſhall reflect upon the dangers to which we have been expos'd; the State of weakneſs and affliction, which we formerly lay under; implied in theſe words, <hi>thou art made whole;</hi> which plainly ſuppoſe an antecedent Infirmity.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, I ſhall conſider the Cauſe of thoſe Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and ſource of that Affliction, Sin; implied in theſe words, <hi>Sin no more, leſt a worſe thing come unto thee;</hi> which clearly intimate, that Sin was the occaſion of the former Evil.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, I ſhall lay before you, the wonderful Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of <hi>Almighty God,</hi> in reſcuing and releaſing us from thoſe Dangers and Afflictions; <hi>Behold, thou art made whole.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4thly. I ſhall examine the caution and advice here given us, how we ought to comport our ſelves under ſuch bleſſings; <hi>Sin no more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5thly, And laſtly, I ſhall urge the threatning or commination, added to this Caution, to ſtrengthen and enforce it; <hi>Sin no more, leſt a worſe thing come unto thee.</hi> Of theſe briefly in their Order.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:54282:6"/>
            <p n="1">1. Then, we are to reflect upon the Dangers to which we have been expos'd; the State of Weakneſs and Affliction which we formerly lay under; implied in theſe Words. <hi>Thou art made whole;</hi> which plainly ſuppoſe an antecdent Imfirmity.</p>
            <p>I do not love to <hi>open</hi> thoſe wounds which are but juſt <hi>skinn'd</hi> over; and by <hi>rubbing</hi> the Sores which are beginning to be <hi>healed,</hi> to <hi>revive</hi> their ſmart and <hi>renew</hi> their anguiſh: But, as a skilful Chirurgeon will rather <hi>ſearch</hi> a Wound, than ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it through careleſsneſs to <hi>mortifie and gangreen,</hi> the great advantage of ſuch a proceeding, making large amends for the painfulneſs of the Operation; ſo ſhall I, by laying open to your view the Troubles and Afflictions which lately threatned you, (however uneaſie the remembrance of them may be) endeavour to prevent your forgetfulneſs of His Mercy, who has graciouſly been pleas'd to deliver you from them, a greater Evil than any you have ſuffer'd, or were in danger to have undergone.</p>
            <p>And I cannot do this more fully or effectually, than by giving you a ſhort Draught of thoſe Miſeries and Afflictions, which your <hi>Proteſtant Brethren in Ireland</hi> did actually ſuſtain; part of weich Hardſhips your ſelves <hi>have felt,</hi> and the reſt of which moſt aſſuredly <hi>were intended</hi> for you.</p>
            <p>Unleſs the uſualneſs and familiarity of lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Accidents, as in the Great and dreadful Plague
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54282:6"/>of <hi>Athens,</hi> has harden'd us againſt the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of them in <hi>others,</hi> or the <hi>apprehenſion</hi> of them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to <hi>our ſelves;</hi> we cannot but call to mind with a tender reſentment, the Miſeries and Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities which thoſe our Brethren underwent. When, as in the ancient <hi>Roman Saturnalia,</hi> the <hi>Servants</hi> took upon them to act the <hi>Maſters;</hi> and kept up that Character with all the inſolence, that uſually attends ſo prepoſterous a Change: When by new and unheard of <hi>Politicks,</hi> the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors</hi> were <hi>diſarm'd,</hi> and the <hi>Sword put</hi> into the Hands of the <hi>vanquiſhed</hi> Nation: When, beſides, the apparent dangers which threatned their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, ſo that (with <hi>David</hi>) they might be ſaid <hi>to hold their Souls continually in their Hands;</hi> their lives were made ſo uneaſie to them, that <hi>Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> was look'd upon as a <hi>favour</hi> to be <hi>begg'd,</hi> as a <hi>purchaſe</hi> to be <hi>bought;</hi> yet neither way could be obtain'd, by ſuch as wiſh'd for and deſir'd it: When the colour of <hi>Law,</hi> and Authority of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> like to <hi>the pillar of cloud and fire,</hi> was to their Adverſaries <hi>light and brightneſs,</hi> to direct them in their ways of Cruelty and Oppreſſion; but unto them <hi>darkneſs and obſcurity,</hi> to cover their Enemies from their ſearch and proſecution: When the <hi>two-edg'd Sword</hi> of pretended <hi>Juſtice</hi> cut but <hi>one</hi> way; and was <hi>blunt</hi> to thoſe, who chiefly deſerv'd to have felt the <hi>edge</hi> of it: When there was nothing but <hi>leading into Captivity and complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in their Streets:</hi> When they eagerly hearkn'd out for Sounds of Joy; and yet every Intelligencer, (like <hi>Job</hi>'s Meſſengers) brought a freſh account of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54282:7"/>Miſeries and Afflictions: But far beyond all this, when the <hi>Lord</hi> ſeem'd, to <hi>caſt off his Altar and abhor his Sanctuary;</hi> when proſperous <hi>Error</hi> and <hi>Superſtition,</hi> prevail'd againſt ſuffering <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Religion;</hi> when the misfortunes of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors,</hi> were made a ſcandal to the <hi>Profeſſion</hi> it ſelf; ſo that <hi>their Enemies did daily caſt them in the Teeth, Where is now your God?</hi> The <hi>Scene</hi> is too diſmal to dwell long upon; I ſhall therefore ſhut it up with the words <hi>of the Prophet</hi> in his <hi>Lamentations, Judah was gone into Captivity, becauſe of Affliction, and becauſe of great ſervitude; ſhe dwelt among the Heathen, ſhe found no reſt, all her Perſecutors overtook her between the Straits; all her Gates were deſolate, her Prieſts ſighed, her Virgins were afflicted, and ſhe was in bitterneſs; her Adverſaries were the chief, her Enemies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper'd;</hi> the reaſon follows immediately after, <hi>for the Lord afflicted her for the multitude of her Tranſgreſſions.</hi> Which leads me to the conſideration of my</p>
            <p n="2">2. Particular, namely to enquire into the Cauſe of theſe Dangers, and ſource of thoſe Afflictions to which we were expos'd, <hi>Sin;</hi> implied in theſe words, <hi>Sin no more, leſt a worſe thing come unto thee;</hi> which clearly intimate, that <hi>Sin</hi> was the occaſion of the former Evil.</p>
            <p>It is very uſual, even with the moſt faulty, to ſhift off the guilt from themſelves, and endeavour to faſten it upon others; and they are apt to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54282:7"/>their Sufferings and Afflictions, rather to the Injuſtice and Malice of their Enemies, than to any Demerits and Tranſgreſſions of their own: But this is a very fallacious way of arguing, with which we too often <hi>deceive our own Souls;</hi> for the Inflicters of <hi>God</hi>'s vengeance may be very ill Men, and yet they who bear the Infliction not a whit the more Innocent; the <hi>Hangman</hi> may be a moſt profligate <hi>Villain,</hi> and yet the <hi>Felon</hi> or the <hi>Traytor</hi> ſuffer juſtly under his Hands: Never was there any Man yet in the World, he only excepted who was <hi>God</hi> as well as <hi>Man,</hi> that could with confidence propound this Queſtion, <hi>Which of you convinces me of Sin?</hi> Every one's own <hi>Conſcience,</hi> unleſs ſear'd or ſtupified, is a <hi>thouſand Witneſſes</hi> againſt him in this caſe; and we cannot but joyn with the <hi>Prophet</hi> in his Confeſſion, <hi>O Lord, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs belongeth unto thee, but unto us confuſion of Faces, becauſe of the Treſpaſs which we have treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed againſt thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For let me, I beſeech you, ask you a few Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and let every one's own Soul ſilently give an Anſwer.</p>
            <p>What effect had that long <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Plenty</hi> upon us, with which it pleaſed God to bleſs theſe Nations, when the whole Chriſtian World beſides felt the <hi>Sword</hi> and <hi>Scarcity,</hi> but <hi>Chambering and Wantonneſs, Rioting and Drunkenneſs, Strifes and Envyings?</hi> What uſe did we make of that abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of <hi>good things,</hi> which the <hi>giver of all good Gifts</hi> imparted to us, but <hi>to make proviſion for the

How empty and ſuperficial was our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion grown! How mere a <hi>Form of godlineſs without the Power of it</hi> was our Religion become! How earneſtly did we contend for <hi>the things of this World,</hi> and how little did we <hi>ſeek thoſe things that are above! God</hi> therefore as well in <hi>Mercy</hi> as in <hi>Juſtice,</hi> awaken'd us by his Judgments from this provoking Security; and like a <hi>careful Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian</hi> to a <hi>Lethargick Patient,</hi> recover'd us with <hi>Cauſticks</hi> and with <hi>Scarifyings,</hi> from a <hi>ſleep</hi> which elſe would have been <hi>unto Death.</hi> Let us not then, in the Name of <hi>God,</hi> look <hi>abroad</hi> for the Cauſes of our Sufferings; let us not flatter our ſelves by imputing them, to the Ambitious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances of Foreign Princes, or the inveterate Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of our Deſigning Neighbours; ſince the main Spring and Original of all, every Man may find <hi>at home, within his own breaſt:</hi> Our Sins cried out to Heaven for Vengeance, and <hi>God</hi> who is Infinite <hi>Juſtice</hi> could not but inflict it; our Offences were hurrying us on to unavoidable ruine, and <hi>God</hi> who is <hi>Mercy in perfection,</hi> could not but uſe the <hi>rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt</hi> Methods to reclaim us, ſince we would not be wrought upon by <hi>milder</hi> diſpenſations.</p>
            <p>And yet even when we thus lay under his chaſtiſements, how little did we take the Advice
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54282:8"/>of the <hi>Prophet, hear ye the Rod, and who hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed it?</hi> Did we not rather give occaſion to <hi>God</hi> to upbraid us, as he did heretofore the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael; and I ſaid, after I had done all theſe things unto her, turn unto me, but ſhe returned not? In thoſe Days did the Lord God of Hoſts call to weeping, and mourning, and to baldneſs, and to girding with Sackcloth; and behold joy and gladneſs, ſlaying Oxen and killing Sheep, eating Fleſh and drinking Wine;</hi> as if we had ſeriouſly made that abſurd concluſion, <hi>Let us eat and drink for to morrow we die!</hi> Theſe ſerious Truths may perhaps be uneaſie to us, but I am ſure they are moſt abundantly neceſſary, that we may not be tempted to <hi>juſtifie our ſelves,</hi> or to aſcribe our deliverance to <hi>our own righteouſneſs;</hi> but only to the <hi>bowels</hi> and <hi>compaſſion</hi> of <hi>him,</hi> whoſe <hi>Mercy towards us en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth for ever, and whoſe hand is mighty to ſave,</hi> and this leads me to the</p>
            <p n="3">3. Particular of my Text, namely, to lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you the wonderful Mercy of <hi>Almighty God,</hi> in reſcuing and releaſing us from thoſe Dangers and Afflictions; <hi>Behold, thou art made whole.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This firſt word, in the Original <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is always rendered by <hi>Lo,</hi> or <hi>Behold;</hi> and is uſed, either to uſher in ſomething amazing and aſtoniſhing, or to prepare our attention for ſomething eminently inſtructive; and it always ſtands in the Writings of the <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> as a Hand in the Margent, to point out ſomewhat more than ordinarily conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54282:9"/>And certainly, if ever any thing deſerv'd to be thus uſher'd in, our releaſement from the Dangers to which we were expos'd, may juſtly challenge ſuch an Introduction, <hi>Behold thou art made whole.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>When the Lord turned again the Captivity of</hi> Jacob, <hi>then were we like to them that dream:</hi> The greatneſs and the ſuddenneſs of the Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, made it rather ſeem a <hi>fancy,</hi> proceeding from the fumes of a diſtemper'd Brain, than a <hi>Truth,</hi> that carried with it what was real and ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. When we were ſo near the brink of Ruine, that there was but a bare poſſibility of our eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping; then <hi>God,</hi> who is <hi>a help in time of need,</hi> ſnatch'd us from the precipice into which we were falling, <hi>and ſet our feet upon a Rock and order'd our goings:</hi> When we lay (like <hi>Iſaac</hi>) a deſtin'd ſacrifice, and the Knife was juſt at our Throates; then an Arm (as it were) out of the Clouds, arreſted the Hands of our <hi>Executioners;</hi> and a Voice as if from Heaven gave command, <hi>Lay not your Hands upon them, neither do any thing unto them:</hi> So that <hi>our Soul eſcaped as a Bird out of the Net of the Fowler, the Net was broken and we were deliver'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might endeavour to ſet off the greatneſs of this Bleſſing, by comparing it with thoſe Miſeries which we lay under, and with thoſe much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ones which threatened to overwhelm us; but this was a Mercy of the firſt Magnitude, which
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54282:9"/>will ſufficiently affect our Souls with gratitude, if we ſet it in a true light, and conſider it by its ſelf: How, by <hi>this, True Religion, the way which thoſe our Enemies call Hereſie, but wherein we wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the God of our Fathers,</hi> was again reſtor'd to its Ancient Splendour! Our <hi>Temples</hi> which they had deſtin'd to <hi>Foppery</hi> and <hi>Superſtition,</hi> were happily continu'd in the poſſeſſion, of <hi>unadulterate Worſhip</hi> and a <hi>reaſonable Service!</hi> The Laws which had been warped to ſerve the worſt Ends, were again reduc'd to their Primitive Uſe, for the <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of wicked Doers, and the praiſe of ſuch as do well!</hi> The <hi>juſt Prerogative</hi> of the <hi>Prince</hi> was vigorouſly aſſerted, and yet the <hi>Liberty</hi> of the <hi>Subject</hi> not at all infringed! The <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> which like ill-yoak'd Oxen drew different ways, now proceed lovingly in the ſame Track, and ſtrengthen and ſupport each other mutually! <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>abundance</hi> begin to efface the Memory, of the <hi>War</hi> and the <hi>neceſſities</hi> under which we lately labour'd! Our Dangers and Apprehenſions are vaniſhed and removed; and if any <hi>Scars</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main of our former <hi>Wounds,</hi> whilſt they put us in mind that we have been <hi>hurt,</hi> they alſo aſſure us that we are in a way to be <hi>healed! Happy are the people who are in ſuch a Caſe,</hi> if they make a right uſe of the Mercies they have receiv'd; <hi>yea, bleſſed are the people who have the Lord for their God!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And certainly, ſo many viſible appearances of the Divine favour, have entitl'd God to the ſole
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54282:10"/>Honour of our Deliverance; that it would be a direct robbing him of his Glory, to give the praiſe of it to any other: He having acted for us in this Caſe, as he teſtifies of himſelf by the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> Iſaiah; <hi>and I looked, and there was none to help, and I wondered that there was none to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold; then my own Arm brought Salvation.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And now wherewithal ſhall we come before the Lord, and bow our ſelves before the high God? What retribution ſhall we make unto the Lord, for all that the Lord has beſtowed upon us, according to his Mercies, and according to the multitude of his loving kindneſſes?</hi> The Anſwer to this Queſtion, which every devout Soul is oblig'd to make, is the ſubject of my</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:54282:10"/>
            <p n="4">4. Particular, in which I am to examine the Caution and Advice here given us, how we ought to comport our ſelves under ſuch bleſſings; <hi>Sin no more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Mercies of <hi>God</hi> are deſign'd for our amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>and his Goodneſs leadeth to repentance;</hi> if therefore we anſwer not this intention of his, we go about as far as in us lies, to diſappoint the gracious Methods of his <hi>Providence,</hi> and as it were to counterplot his <hi>Omniſcence.</hi> But <hi>God forbid, that where his Grace has ſo</hi> ſignally <hi>abounded to us, there Sin ſhould abound ſo much more! God forbid,</hi> that we ſhould continue obſtinate and incorrigible, againſt all that an <hi>All powerful</hi> and <hi>All-wiſe God</hi> can do for our amendment! If <hi>Judgments</hi> could not <hi>frighten</hi> us into Obedience, yet let <hi>Bleſſings allure</hi> us; and like the Man in the <hi>Fable,</hi> who <hi>held faſt</hi> his Cloak againſt the bluſtering <hi>Wind,</hi> but <hi>parted</hi> with it to the gentler Rays of the <hi>Sun;</hi> So let us, if we have <hi>kept</hi> our Sins cloſe to us in the <hi>Storms</hi> of Adverſity, <hi>diſmiſs</hi> them when we are warmed with the <hi>Beams</hi> of Proſperity. Ingratitude (we know) is ſtiled a complication of all Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and no Title is ſo reproachful, as that of an unthankful Perſon; but how deeply ſhall we be liable to this imputation, if we will make no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn for ſuch ineſtimable advantages? And yet how eaſie is the Tribute which God expects at our hands! He only requires of us, that we ſhould <hi>Sin no more;</hi> That inſtead of provoking him to new <hi>Severities,</hi> we ſhould put our ſelves into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54282:11"/>of recieving freſh <hi>Bleſſings:</hi> Had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing very difficult been exacted of us, when we lay expos'd to the Oppreſſion of our inſulting E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, would we have ſcrupled to perform it for our releaſement from them? And ſhall we now ſtartle at that which is both eaſie and beneficial? <hi>God's Yoke is eaſie, and his Burthen is light; his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments are not grievous, neither does he delight to afflict the Sons of Men:</hi> And yet how few are obedient to ſuch <hi>equitable</hi> Injunctions! How few ſubmit entirely to ſo <hi>mild</hi> an Authority! Is not the ſame Profaneneſs and Debauchery ſtill rife amongſt us, which drew down thoſe Judgments we formerly groan'd under? Do we not ſtill uſe the ſame falſe balances and deceitful Weights? Do we not ſtill practice the ſame over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaching ſubtilties, in our uſual Dealings and mutual Commerce? Is not all the Violence and Injuſtice, for which we were wont to blame our Enemies, ſtill exercis'd amongſt our ſelves, and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated by the profeſſion of a better Religion? So that I may ſay, in the words of the <hi>Prophet, the Lord looked for Judgment, but behold Opreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for righteouſneſs, but behold a Cry!</hi> Do not thoſe that ſeem'd to lament and bewail, the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of looſing the <hi>Publick Aſſemblies;</hi> abſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves too often from the <hi>Great Congregation;</hi> and leave the <hi>Houſe of God,</hi> at the ordinary times of Divine Worſhip, much more unfrequented than it need or ought to be? Do not thoſe who apprehended a <hi>Dearth in the Land, not a Dearth of Bread,</hi> but <hi>of the Word and Sacraments,</hi> withdraw too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54282:11"/>from the <hi>Bread of Life,</hi> end <hi>Starve</hi> their own Souls in the midſt of <hi>Plenty? Let us judge our ſelves, my Brethren, that we be not judged of the Lord;</hi> and let us conſider, that the caution here given, <hi>Sin no more,</hi> is not a bare Advice, that may be taken or rejected without any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Conſequences; but that in the</p>
            <p n="5">5th. And laſt Particular of my Text, there is a Threatning or Commination, and that a very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere One, annexed to it, to ſtrengthen and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force it; <hi>Sin no more, leſt a worſe thing come unto thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>Relapſe</hi> into any illneſs, is much more dangerous, than the <hi>firſt fury</hi> of a <hi>Diſtemper;</hi> and we read of the Man, <hi>that waſhed and ſwept and garniſhed his Houſe,</hi> and yet <hi>admitted ſeven Devils afterwards, that his laſt Eſtate was worſe than his firſt.</hi> For <hi>God,</hi> in his Impartial <hi>Juſtice,</hi> proportions his Judgments to our Offences; now every <hi>latter</hi> Sin is greater than the <hi>former,</hi> and therefore is liable to a more ſevere pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment: For either <hi>we have</hi> repented before the Commiſſion of it, <hi>or we have not;</hi> if <hi>we have,</hi> our Sin, beſides its own guilt, includes that of breaking our Reſolution; <hi>if we have not,</hi> it is an additio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Act of Obſtinacy and Impenitency; and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, it has a new acceſſion of Guilt and Wickedneſs.</p>
            <p>Nor can we hope to eſcape from <hi>God's</hi> juſt Severity; ſince Sin, is that <hi>dark Body</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſes
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54282:12"/>between us and the <hi>light of his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi> and puniſhment is the <hi>Shadow</hi> that inſeparably accompanies it: Neither will the Faults of thoſe who ſeem to be the Miniſters of <hi>God's Vengeance,</hi> be any manner of Protection to us; nor muſt we flatter ourſelves, that he will not fight againſt us on <hi>their</hi> ſide: <hi>Executioners</hi> (we know) are ſeldom choſen out of the <hi>beſt</hi> of Men; and the <hi>Rod</hi> may be <hi>made uſe of,</hi> tho' it be afterwards to be <hi>caſt into the Fire;</hi> Nay even <hi>lice</hi> and <hi>flies,</hi> the meaneſt particles of the Creation, have oftentimes in the avenging hand of God, been <hi>dreadful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments</hi> of his diſpleaſure.</p>
            <p>If therefore we are unwilling, to lie under the ſame or greater preſſures, than we lately appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, and were deliver'd from; it we would not run through, the ſame or a more diſmal Scene of Afflictions, than we formerly groan'd under, and had in proſpect; if we would not rather, have <hi>God</hi> act the part of an <hi>offended Judge,</hi> than that of a <hi>tender</hi> and <hi>Indulgent Parent;</hi> Let us follow the Advice preſcrib'd us in the Text, and <hi>Sin no more, leſt a worſe thing come unto us.</hi> God has been pleas'd to Viſit us with <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and we continu'd incorrigible under them, by which our Sins were highly aggravated; but if his <hi>Bleſſings</hi> are in vain employed for our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ndment, we offend to a Degree as high as is poſſible: In the former indeed we ſinned againſt his <hi>Juſtice,</hi> but in this both againſt his <hi>Juſtice</hi> and his <hi>Mercy:</hi> And will not <hi>God,</hi> think you,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54282:12"/>vindicate this his <hi>Beloved,</hi> his <hi>Darling</hi> attribute, from ſuch a contempt? What will become of us, when his <hi>Mercy</hi> is turned againſt us? When that which uſed to <hi>reſtrain</hi> and <hi>qualifie</hi> the Inflictions of his <hi>Juſtice,</hi> ſhall then <hi>exaſperate</hi> and make them <hi>ſharper?</hi> When that which uſed to be poured like <hi>Balſam</hi> into our <hi>wounds,</hi> ſhall then be like <hi>Oyl</hi> to feed the <hi>Flames</hi> of his Fury, and to make his Vengeance <hi>burn</hi> more fiercely? When our depraved Natures, like vitiated Stomachs, that convert wholeſome Nouriſhment into the aliment of ill Humors, ſhall turn <hi>Bleſſings</hi> themſelves into <hi>Curſes?</hi> Yet thus moſt certainly it will be with us, if we ſtill remain impenitent; God will <hi>be glorified</hi> one way or other, either <hi>by us,</hi> or <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us but ſeriouſly meditate upon thoſe ſad Calamities, which oppreſs <hi>our Proteſtant Brethren</hi> in diſtant Countreys; and we ſhall ſee in them what our Sins will bring upon us, unleſs we prevent thoſe Judgments by a timely Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: We cannot look upon them as more guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty then ourſelves, nay, I would to God we could vie with them for Innocence!

            </p>
            <p>To look back then to my Text, from which I have ſo long digreſſed; and to cloſe up all that has been deduced from it: <hi>I beſeech you, Beloved, in the bowels of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> ſo to reflect upon your own paſt <hi>Sufferings,</hi> and the greater <hi>Dangers</hi> which were ready to over-take you, and upon your <hi>Sins</hi> which were the occaſions of them; as to deteſt and abominate the <hi>latter,</hi> for the ſake of the two <hi>former:</hi> So to meditate upon the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Goodneſs,</hi> in reſcuing us from thoſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries to which we were expos'd; as to give <hi>God</hi> the glory of it; by Piety towards him, the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Author of it; and <hi>love</hi> to one another, the mutual ſharers in it: That ſo, we who <hi>are made whole, by ſinning no more,</hi> may avoid the danger, of having a <hi>worſe thing come unto us:</hi> That ſo, we <hi>becoming a peculiar People, purified unto God, zealous of good Works; the Lord God may make us
